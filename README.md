With an extreme commitment to each work that I do, I keep a significant priority on instituting analytical and responsive IT directions with attention to detail for operational excellence. My competency in IT management, infrastructure administration, and cloud engineering will surely allow me to exceed demands. 

With my years of valuable experience, I bring my track record of championing technical culture by embodying accountability, commitment, and growth-oriented mindset. My mastery lies in technical development, service management, solution implementation, and security development. UI/UX design, penetration testing, CI/CD development, and workflow automation are also areas where I have expertise. Further, I possess proficiency in requirements gathering, resource maximization, change development, risk mitigation, and issue resolution.

As I seek to further my career, I put forth my servant leadership skills, logical problem-solving skills, firm decision-making skills, good time management skills, great organizational skills, and firm work ethic, especially since I have always been regarded as someone who can carry out competing priorities in changing environments. Additionally, I can work closely with service levels through enforcement of my excellent interpersonal skills for achievement of shared vision.

Technically-inclined and methodical are two traits I bring to the table. I am open to professional networking. You can reach me here or via email at searlasjourney@gmail.com.

Looking forward to adding value to you!
